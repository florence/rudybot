{"name":"Rudybot","tagline":"Just what the world needs: another IRC bot","body":"If you're just trying the bot out, start it via\r\n``./freenode-main.rkt`` at the shell (simply doing ``racket\r\nfreenode-main.rkt`` will fail mysteriously).  If you want it to run\r\ncontinuously, and happen to have [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/)\r\navailable (which in practice means you're running Ubuntu), you can\r\ncopy ``rudybot.conf`` to ``/etc/init`` and then ``# start rudybot``.\r\n\r\nGetting an error about ``rackunit`` not being available?  That can be\r\ncaused by using the ``racket-textual`` package instead of ``racket``.\r\n\r\nRun the tests like this:\r\n\r\n    $ raco test -x .\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you'll have to pay attention to the output of ``raco\r\ntest``, since it will likely exit with 0 status even if some of the\r\ntests fail.  This is IMHO a misfeature of ``raco test``; the Racket\r\ndevelopers seem disinclined to change it (see\r\n[this bug report](http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13573)).\r\n\r\n# Some specs:\r\n\r\n- [rfc1459][]\r\n- [ctcpspec][]\r\n\r\n[rfc1459]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459\r\n[ctcpspec]: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
